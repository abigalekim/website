I'm a Fifth Year Research Master's student in the [Computer Science Department](https://csd.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), studying database management systems (DBMSs). My advisor is [Dr. Andy Pavlo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/), and I am a member of the [CMU DB Group](https://noise.page/people/). My academic interests are database management systems and computer science education.

Previously, I was a Software Engineer at [TileDB](https://tiledb.com/), working on their [open-source data engine](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB). I completed my B.Sc. at Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science, majoring in computer science with a concentration in computer systems.
