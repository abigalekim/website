I'm a Software Engineer at [TileDB](https://tiledb.com/), working on their [open-source data engine](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB).Previously, I was a Fifth Year Research Master's student in the [Computer Science Department](https://csd.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I was advised by [Dr. Andy Pavlo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/). At CMU, I studied database system extensibility. My academic interests are database management systems and computer science education.

I completed my B.Sc. at Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science, majoring in computer science with a concentration in computer systems.
