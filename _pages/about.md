I'm a PhD student in the [Computer Sciences Department](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin, Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Xiangyao Yu](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yxy/), and am a member of the [UW-Madison Databases Group](https://database.cs.wisc.edu/). Previously, I was a Software Engineer at [TileDB](https://tiledb.com/), working on their [open-source data engine](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB). I completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. at 
[Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science](https://csd.cmu.edu/), where I was advised by [Dr. Andy Pavlo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/). My academic interests are database management systems and computer science education.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to [Taylor Swift](https://twitter.com/abigale_kim/status/1645590351166722050) and fiber crafting. Feel free to reach out abigalekim0417[at]gmail[dot]com or abigale[at]cs[dot]wisc[dot]edu. I'm happy to chat and connect!
